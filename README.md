A simple CashRegister
Problem: Time consuming way of Writing sales on a notebook.
Solution: Automize it along with Additional Cash Register.

So i was really having a hard time on understanding TDD-development and i found this video on youtube linked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMU_hninZAs&t=499s 
and so i just followed his initial steps and then started to implement it on my project thankfully my project is SUPER simple (basi pang elementary java lang ni).
I utilized the tests to create new classes and methods, then tests them again and again until i reached a desirable out come.

Regarding Design patterns, i believe i utilized Factory and Facade patterns, Factory in a way that there's a set instructions/method on my Menu interface and i just applied 
it on the three different classes/products and facade that hides the workings on the background making the main class less sloppy and messy.

On the best practices, i think first and foremost i used the camelNotation on naming wherein variables done have the first letter capitalized
also the practice on the conditionals,
  if {
  } else if {
  }
  else if //one line code
  else
  type of thing, not sure if this is a part of a best practices since i just crammed that lesson xD.
  I think most of the best practice that is present on my code is because of the IDE... sad.
